# What is a package

+  an installable unit of R code and/or data
    + a collection of functions
    + data objects
+ documentation
+ easy to install &amp; share with others.

---
# Working with Packages

+ Basic installation

+ From within R
```
install.packages("package")
install.packages("package", repos = NULL)
install.packages("package.tar.gz", repos = NULL)
```
+ From github via devtools
```
devtools::install_github("dsidavis/RMinPackage")
```

+ Local packages from terminal command line
```
R CMD INSTALL package.tar.gz
R CMD INSTALL packageDirectory
```
   +  Download the package via Web browser, git clone, your own package...

---

<!--
  install.packages(  repos = )
   -->

---

# Where is the Package Installed

+ Library versus package
   + Library is a directory which contains one or more installed packages.

+ R has recommended packages in its own R directory
+ When you install a new package, typically don't have permissions to write there.
+ R will ask to create your own library directory.

+ You can create this ahead of time as any directory.
+ Specify your own collection of R library directories
  + R_LIBS or R_LIBS_USER environment variable.
  + Via .libPaths() R function.

+ Installing into personal "libraries"
+ Multiple libraries and versions of packages
+ Configuring a package for installation.


----
# Installing and Loading a Package

+ Installing a package is separate from loading it into an R session
+ install.packages("RMinPackage", repos = "http://dsi.ucdavis.edu/R", type = "source")
+ library()



---
# Packages - Loading and Attaching

+ Difference between loading a package and attaching to the search path

+ Loading: refer explicitly to a variable in a package, load another package that imports/depends on package
+ Attaching:  library() and require()

+ Load the package but don't attach it to the search path
```
  search()
  XML::xmlParse 
  search()

+ But attaching it changes the search path
```
  library(XML)
  search()
  xmlParse
  XML::xmlParse
```

---
# :: and ::: in R

+ What's the difference between :: and :::?


---



---
# Writing Packages

## Why write a package

+  If you want to install your code on multiple machines (e.g. laptop, desktop, compute server, cluster)
    + e.g. to run parallel code on different machines
    + easier with a package than loose collection of R files.

+ Easy to share code with others and yourself.
+ Creating a package is very easy and gives you a single unit (not loose files).
+ If you want help debugging your code, much easier to give somebody a package they can install and run
  your example to get error.

+ Contributes to academic community
+ Promotes your ideas.
+ Get feedback on your ideas.

---
# Anatomy of a Package

+ Directory containing
   + **DESCRIPTION** file
   + **NAMESPACE** file
   + **R** directory

+ Additional directories
   + **man** - help files
   + **tests** - tests to check the package
   + **data** - data provided by the package
   + **inst** - other files to be installed with the package



---
#  DESCRIPTION file
## Fields

+ Package - name of package.
    + One word/phrase - no spaces
+ Version - version number of for *major-minor.patch*
+ Title - short description of the package
+ Description - longer description of package
    + put space at start of 2nd, 3rd, ... line
+ Author - name of authors, or can be an R expression creating author list object
+ Maintainer - name and email of one person responsible for answering questions
+ License - see below
+ Depends, Imports, Suggests - see below
+ Collate

---

# Version Number

+ Version numbers look like
```
major-minor.patch
2-34.2
```
+ patch - fix a bug, documentation, etc. but no new features/functionality
+ minor - new feature - e.g. new function, new parameter(s) for one or more functions, new example(s)
+ major - either
   + cumulative critical mass of new functionality worthy of note
   + change to functionality and/or API that is not backward compatible with previous version.


---
# R code

+ Put the R code in the R directory

+ Typically collection of functions
+ Code will be source()d at installation time
   + Any expressions will be evaluated then, not when the package is loaded.
   + See .onAttach()

+ Organize functions
    + one per file
    + related functions in one file
    + all functions in one file.
    + S4 class definitions in one file, generics in another, methods in other files. 
---

# NAMESPACE file

+ 2 purposes
    + import packages or functions from other packages that this package uses
    + export functions/variables for user to see (via `ls("package:MyPackage")`)

+ Exporting functions
   + export()
   + exportPattern()
```
# By regular expression
exportPattern(".*")
exportPattern("^[a-z].*")

# or explicitly
export(foo, bar)
export(foobar)
```

---

# Imports and Dependencies

+ It is good for one package to use functionality from another.
   + Don't reinvent the wheel


---
# NAMESPACE and S3 and S4 methods

+ For S3 methods, e.g. `plot.matrix`, `[[.XMLAbstractNode`
```
S3method(plot, matrix)
S3method("[[", XMLAbstractNode)
```

+ For S4 methods
   + export generic.  Often import it from other package, then export
   + export each method
```
importFrom("graphics", "plot")
importFrom("base", "[[")
export("plot", "[[")
exportMethods("plot", "[[")
```

---
# Installing a Local Package

+ *Shell*:  `R CMD INSTALL path/to/directoryName`
+ *R*:  `install.packages("path/to/directoryName", repos = NULL)`

# Action when Package is Loaded - `.onLoad()`, `.onUnload()`

+ For some packages, we may need to do something when it is first loaded, e.g.,
  + create a temporary directory or an R environment object to cache data objects
  + create an instance of  C/C++ level data structure
+ And when the package is implicitly unloaded (when no longer needed), clean up.

+ Define a function named
```
.onLoad = function(...)
{

}
```
and similarly `.onUnload()`.

+ R calls these when the package is loaded and unloaded.

+ These are different from .onAttach() and .onDetach().


---
# C/C++/FORTRAN code

+ A package can contain C/C++/FORTRAN code
+ Put these in the **src/** directory.
+ `R CMD INSTALL`/`install.packages()` will take care of compiling this code and creating a shared library (DLL/DSO)
   with the name of the package.
+ We arrange for the package to load this DLL when the package is first used via useDynLib() in the NAMESPACE file.
```
useDynLib(RMinCompiledPackage)
```
  + Can register the native routines in the useDynLib() to precache them, limit what can be found, etc.


+ If the C/C++/FORTRAN compiler need specific options, put these in `src/Makevars`.
```
PKG_CPPFLAGS=-DENABLE_R=1
```

---

# Compiled Code

+ R CMD INSTALL and install.packages() will compile .c/.cc/.cpp/.f files, build the DLL/DSO.

+ When developing the package, can be useful to compile files individually
with 
```
R CMD COMPILE foo.c
```
+ You can then fix errors and recompile.

---
# Controlling the Compilation
## Example: RMinTesseract

+ For your own or another package, sometimes need to pass specific options
to the compiler and linker
+ Some are
    + specific to the package's code, (e.g., preprocess defines, -I for include directories)
    + general for the compiler (e.g. -g for debugging)

+ Put general compilation flags in ~/.R/Makevars for use in compiling all packages.
+ Put package-specific in src/Makevars

---

# Configuring a Package
## Example: RMinTesseractDynConf

+ Many packages are pure R code or contain self-contained C code.
+ However, some depend on system-specific executables or compiled libraries and header files.
+ Often, we have to find these at installation time, e.g. to compile and create the DLL/DSO.
+ Need to search the installation machine for its characteristics and where the relevant files are located.
+ On Linux/OSX, we typically use an autoconf script for this -
   + **configure** script generated from **configure.in** or **configure.ac**

---
# Autoconf Configure

## Example: RMinTesseractDynConf

+ Write configure.in (or configure.ac)
+ Generate configure shell script from configure.in using
```
autoconf
```

+ R will see the configure file and run it before installing the package.
+ The configure script typically looks for files, attempts compilation, linking
+ Then writes out compiler options and other information
   + AC_OUTPUT(src/Makevars)
   + Replaces the values of specified variables in the script with @VARIABLE_NAME@ in files named, e.g., src/Makevars.in

+ Can substitute content into .R files
```
AC_OUTPUT(R/data.R)
```
   for R/data.R.in   


---
# Testing a Package

+ Check R CMD INSTALL works
+ Then, build as tar.gz file then check from that.
+ `R CMD build path/to/package`
+ Then use `R CMD check`
+ `R CMD check package_&lt;ersion&gt;.tar.gz`

+ You can R CMD check path/to/package but not as good a test
    + Left over files in the directory.

---
# Automated Testing On Git Commit

+ When commit a change to the package git repository, immediately run R CMD check.

+ Can use Travis CI - Continuous Integration

+ [https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/r/](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/r/)

---
# Package Builds and Ignoring Files

+ We often have extraneous files in our package that are not intended to be shipped
   + .git, .svn, backup files, log files, .tar.gz files, .....
+ We exclude these when we **build** the archive for the package
   + Specify patterns to ignore via .Rbuildignore

+ These patterns are regular expressions (PCRE)

   
---

# Shipping a Package

+ Available via github.com and devtools::install_github()
+ As source tar ball
```
R CMD build path/to/package
```
  gives, e.g., package_0.3-0.tar.gz


---
# Submitting to CRAN

+ Run
```
R CMD build myPackage
R CMD check --as-cran myPackage_&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz 
```

+ You must remove all Errors, Warnings
+ Address all NOTEs

+ Repet this on as many different machines and operating systems as possible.
  + Linux and different distributions
  + OS X
  + Windows (10, ...).

---

# Git and Package Releases

+ When you release a version, good to put a tag on the git repository corresponding to the commit for that release.

+ When dealing with bug/issue reports, can then checkout that tag.



+ When developing new features, good to be on a branch.
   + Allows users to install stable version directly from github.
   + When branch is stable, merge into default master branch.
   + Users can still install from any development branch for experimental features.


---
# Your Own Repository

+ Putting a package on CRAN means binary builds for most platforms.

+ However, can be useful to provide your own repository
   + source version
   + binary for different operating systems.

+ On Web site, create
   + src/contrib
   + bin/macosx/contrib and/or bin/windows/contrib

+ Put source .tar.gz files for packages in src/contrib (from `R CMD build`)

+ In src/contrib, build PACKAGES index file for packages
```
tools:::write_PACKAGES()
```

+ R Users can then, for example, 
```
available.packages(repos = "http://dsi.ucdavis.edu/R", type = "source")
```
   + We put these under the R/ directory within the top-level directory of the DSI web site.
   + So URL is http://dsi.ucdavis.edu/R

+ Put binaries in directories bin/macosx/contrib/  identified by version number, e.g, 3.4, 3.3, 3.5
  + e.g.  `bin/macosx/contrib/3.5`

+ Build PACKAGES file in that directory.

+
```
p = available.packages(repos = "http://dsi.ucdavis.edu/R", type = "mac.binary")
```


---
# R Code in Packages

+ When writing a package for your own use, anything goes.

+ For others to use, you need 
   + the code to be robust to different inputs
       + check class/type of inputs, lengths, NAs, 
   + to provide meaningful error messages
   + to provide good documentation, examples and vignettes
   + answer questions promptly
   + avoid reimplementing functions in existing packages.

+ Make the functions flexible
   + add parameters to allow the caller to specify values you compute within the function.
   + customize computations with parameters and functions

+ Make extensible
   + Use classes and methods
   + Allow the user to define their own sub-classes and methods and to provide objects from these classes.

+ Anticipate different uses.

---

# Un-seminar

+ February 6th,  DSI Class room (here)

+ Discussion about challenges of
finding functionality because of so many R packages that provide similar
functionality.

+ This should be a very interesting discussion.
