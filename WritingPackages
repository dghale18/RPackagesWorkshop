Creating a package is quite straightforward.
RStudio, the kitten package and the function package.skeleton()
provide convenience facilities to create them.
These are easy to use. We'll focus on what it does and
the actual structure and anatomy of an R package.
There are three reasons for this: 1) when things go wrong,
you can reason about what they are, 2)
if you want to do something that the point-and-click interface
doesn't support, you have to do things manually anyway and then interact
with the actual package structure, 3) you still have to fill in the files
that are generated for you, so you have to know the basic structure and purpose
of the files.

Sometimes we start with one or more R files and want to create a package.
Othertimes we'll start with nothing created and decide  to create a package.
And sometimes we'll create a new package and move existing code into it.

First off, use version control (git, mercurial/hg, subversion, etc.) when creating a package.
